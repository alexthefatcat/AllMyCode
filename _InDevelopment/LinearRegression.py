"""   Simple linear regression is what you can use when you have one independent variable and one dependent variable. 
      Multiple linear regression is what you can use when you have a bunch of different independent variables!
        
        Multiple regression analysis has three main uses.
        
          > You can look at the strength of the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
          > You can use it to ask how much the dependent variable will change if the independent variables are changed.
          > You can also use it to predict trends and future values.
        
        There are some assumptions that absolutely have to be true:
        
          > There is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
          > The independent variables arenâ€™t too highly correlated with each other.
          > Your observations for the dependent variable are selected independently and at random.
          > Regression residuals are normally distributed.
